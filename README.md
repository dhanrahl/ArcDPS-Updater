# ArcDPS-Updater
Powershell Script to Auto-Update ArcDPS

Very simple script to update your ArcDPS DLLs with the click of a button, without the hassle of doing all the steps manually.

This does require you to place the BATCH and PS1 files into their own folder, and to create a shortcut to the BATCH file that you can place on your desktop, or call via commandline.

In ArcDPS.ps1 there is a variable that requires you to enter the path of your GW2/Bin64 folder.
